# Generic Blank

Generic Blank is a template repo for a VCV Rack plugin.
It is designed to avoid the stumbling blocks and limitations of the VCV Rack tutorial that many newcomers encoutner when first making a VCV Rack plugin.

This plugin contains only a blank panel module.

> This example doc index is minimal, given that the plugin contains only one module.
In practice, the table above would have a row for each module in the plugin.
